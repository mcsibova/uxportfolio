            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I was born and raised in Slovakia, studied aesthetics and German language at Comenius University in Bratislava, and a few years later I was professionally qualified in management with a Bachelor's degree. After many years working as a sales administrator I've chosen to make a U-turn in my career path and switch my avocation into profession. My passion for art led me to the design field.

            <h2>Photo Manipulation</h2>
            <p>In order to create unique graphic design it's inevitable to work with unrepeated resources. As an amateur photographer I often use my own photographs in graphic design.</p>
